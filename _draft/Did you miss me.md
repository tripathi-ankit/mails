We know your excitement level when seeing this mail is less intense than the one you had seeing Gandalf return in The Two Towers, but we have few interesting things to…err…interest you into reading this mail further. 
WE ARE BACK!!

Yeah…one of our favourite moments of Sherlock as well.
We have meticulously (thanks, Thesaurus) worked hard over the past few months to bring you a better experience at Rime. We have always maintained that we will give your “complete picture” to your target audience and we thusly release Rime 3.0 to make a step further. 
Below are the feature-set of our new release.

- No password : Now you don’t need to remember password to login rime. You can sign in with third-party service providers: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Google—or directly using your email address. 
- @username : Your @ username is more meaningful now. We have included your profession history, Places you have visited and all of your social footprints on the internet.
- Guest Profile : We built world’s first platform where you can create complete social media wiki of your favourite people.
